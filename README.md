# 🧠 Facial Keypoints Detection

This project is part of the [Kaggle Facial Keypoints Detection Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/facial-keypoints-detection).  
It focuses on predicting 15 facial keypoints (eyes, nose, mouth corners, etc.) from grayscale face images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
